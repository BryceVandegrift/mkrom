# mkrom

Writes individual files into a ROM image

## Usage

    $ mkrom <output> <length> [files...]

## Installation

For Linux/Mac/etc, install cmake, make, asciidoc, and a C compiler, then:

    $ cmake .
    $ make
    # make install # as root

On Windows, do the same thing under cygwin after installing cmake, your favorite C compiler, and asciidoc.
